Soccer:
Firstly, i’d like to say that soccer is my favorite hobby out of all. I believe that ball is life to begin with and it will always be the best sport. So many legends have came out from the game, legends from all over the world who have mastered it as well.
 Some current soccer stars can include such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. 
But personally, I think Cristiano is the one of the greatest players to have ever played the game.
 I currently play in a soccer team with my friend and I take the position of last man defender My current number is 12 but I have taken others like 7 and 14. At times, I take the role of captain of the team and it is a team that I am very proud to be in, even if we cannot win all games.

Video Games:
Secondly, another hobby which I enjoy, is playing video games.
 I would say that I was once able to play them all day long but school has prevented from me doing that with all the work. 
I still enjoy it though and my current favorite game is Fifa 17. 
 Ever since a kid, I just loved playing them, it was very addicting to just go through levels of games and not stop. I think that I will never give up the love for these gaming system as I have dedicated so much time into these games that I think i will never be able to let it go.

Music:
	Lastly, one more example of a hobby which I really enjoy is music. 
I have always loved the concept of music. Currently, I am waiting for an instrument which I ordered which is a bass guitar. Ever since I can remember,
 I have always wanted to play some type of instrument but I wasn’t able to figure which one i wanted to play. Finally, after paying attention to the music I chose that I wanted to play a bass guitar because of the amazing sound it makes when being play. Also, I read a lot about the bass guitar and found some amazing artist who changed how it can be played. Like for example, my role model for trying to learn to play the bass guitar is the famous bassist Flea. He plays with the band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and is ranked as one of the greatest bassist to have ever played. Not only that but I also like different types of bands but my favorite will have to be The Beatles. Just the harmony they make, can make any situation better because music means so much to me.
